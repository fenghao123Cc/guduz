The Internet Traffic congestion avoidance algorithms are becoming
crucial for the traffic optimization, fair use of resources and
quality of service. Guduz or YaRED is a simple and flexible
implementation of Random Early Detection algorithm of Sally Floyd,
Van Jacobson. It can be used as an educational tool or to understand
the basics of the RED algorithm.

Note: Authors of this code has developed a modified version of the original RED that
removes queue weight parameter by using a master equation taking queue length as a stochastic variable ([mRED](http://code.google.com/p/mred/)).
